I was looking for a replacement for my xc gloves, but didn't want to spend a premium for one.  So, I checked out the Lerway full finger gloves and it checked all the boxes for what I am looking for.-It has perforations on the palm and finger areas for ventilation.-gel pads.-absorbent cloth material on the backside of the thumb to wipe your sweat.-light and comfortable material for extended bike days.Finally, a material on the finger tip so you would be able to use your phone without removing your gloves.Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it for those budget conscious riders looking for quality gloves.
I was hesitant to get this because I have never heard of the brand. But the price was affordable if it doesn't perform well.I've been using this for almost a month now and I love the fit! Not too tight. Not loose. Just right. It's starting to get warm here so we'll see what happens when the temperature rises, but so far I still feel comfortable using this whatever time I ride.What really surprised me are the grippy stripes in the palm area. The additional grip these gloves give is awesome! When I'm trying to adjust my hands in the middle of technical terrain, I used to be concerned my hands might slip off my handlebars. Then I'd feel the grippy stripes hold and it would help assure me there isn't an accident waiting to happen.These are great gloves! Highly recommended.
So I bought a pair of these and now have been riding with them for over 500 hard mountain bike miles. The pics are what they currently look like.  My favorite full finger gloves up until these were my old fox reflex glove (pics for reference).  Fox discontinued this glove and I had been looking for a light weight summer glove with good grip and was more breathable than current fox offerings.  These gloves fit that bill. The sweat wipe on the thumb is very welcome, and they just work with touch screens which is a plus also.  These are not winter gloves, but add that extra grip you need during riding season.  The rubber printing on the palm adds a lot of grip.  Just wish there was some rubber on the pointer finger for breaking.  My finger hasn't slipped but would be a welcome addition.  Overall these are great gloves.  So good I just bought another set!
The build quality of these gloves is excellent. They breathe really well due to the mesh top. The mesh seems like it will hold up over time. It would be nice to have some type of knuckle protection though; perhaps a small raised rubber strip down each finger that could absorb some impact. The padding on the palm is minimal and slightly less than another discount pair of MTB gloves I have. Stitching throughout is quality and no internal seams causing irritation or bulk between fingers. The grip of the palm is excellent and I never felt like it was slipping. Over all I like them and would buy again if they increased the palm padding by a mm or two and provided some knuckle protection.
Another great LERWAY product being put to the test here.  I really love the way the gloves feel and hold up as Iâ€™m hard on gloves.  Living in Florida, I train in heavy sweat shirts/pants in the summer so race days are conditioned and easier to handle the hot weather.  This often times presents a lot of sweaty hands and gloves hate me but these really wicked the sweat away and held up great.  The materials are really nice and feel great.  They run a little smaller than my Troy Lee Design gloves so maybe order up a size if you are on the middle line.  Overall, great purchase.
"Medium is a great fit for a 7.5"" diameter hand.  Snug but not constricting.  Lightweight breathable shell for the back of your hand that probably wouldn't provide too much protection but nobody uses the back of their hands to break their landing when falling.  Good choice for material.Touch screen feature is not great.  Gloves weren't dirty but I had a heck of a time trying to use my touchscreen Garmin watch.  It worked eventually but it almost felt like my watch felt sorry for me trying so hard to get the gloves to work that it just gave in.I love these gloves!"
I have been using these gloves for a couple of months now.  What I like about them is that they fit my hand snugly (I don't like gloves that have too much material that ends up bunching up between my hands and the grips on my bike when I sweat -- I live in Florida), and just enough padding in the places where I want it.  I can also operate my iPhone while wearing them while still having my fingertips protected when I crash (something I try to avoid, but... ).  I was hesitant to get size large, as I usually go with XL, but for the money, I figured that I would give them a shot.  The finger length is a little under what I would like, but as I wear them more, they have begun to loosen up.  All-in-all, an excellent value for the price.
Ok, I have big palms but short fingers. Most gloves have long fingers so I end up with floppy material at the end. These fingers are almost too short. I think xl would be better for me but I'm going with the thought it'll stretch out as I'd rather that than have long fingers. Highly recommend going one size up as medium was supposedly my size when I measured but that was so small as to be laughable. Returned medium for large and am keeping those.
If you want a lightweight full finger glove these are great. Abundant padding in the palm. The back is a very lightweight material so your hands can breathe a bit. Summer gloves, these are NOT cold weather gloves. I ride in FL and like a full finger glove, these fit the bill.  Because they are lightweight the do not provide any knuckle protection.  Terry cloth seat/nosewiper on the thumb is handy.I often wear an XL, thankfully there is some stretch so the size L just barely fits my hand.
Great Gloves. I have a good 100 miles on them and I'm very pleased so far.I WOULD RECOMMEND these Leerway Gloves.The gloves fit well and breath nicely.The top of hand material is a tight mesh. The palm appears to be man made suede. There are well positioned pads on the heel of the hand (impact zone) and near the base of the fingers. These proved both protection and improved grip. They are hit and miss when it comes to using with touch screen electronic devices, which is their only weak point. The Velcro seems to be holding up well and the stitching is holding as it should. No loose threads, no misaligned seams. I believe this company intends to become a market contender and if they continue with the quality and innovated design I found in these gloves, I would consider them as having a shot. I will be buying extra pairs soon.
