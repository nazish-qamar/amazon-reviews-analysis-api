WARM AND LIGHT WEIGHT
This fit perfectly. Highly recommend.
This hat is super cute. Fits true to size. Soft thick material. It’s not a typical knit hair the material is thicker.
I ordered this for my 11 year old great grandson. I didn't know if he would of liked it. Well, he loved it!
My nephew LOVED his hat!!  Thank you ❤️
Hat looks a little flimsy not really tabagon style as pictured
Cool hat. I also have it in gray.
I cant return it because I sent it to someone who lives far and they can't send it back to me but it is way way too big for a 16 year old boy and I am very upset that he got this crappy so so so big hat that he can not use now for his Christmas. I wasted my money and the boy is upset ans do am I. They should refund me so I can buy him something else for Christmas. This is so sad!
It’s not a bad hat. I got it to cover my head when I play airsoft and it’s lightweight which is nice because it gets really hot there. The biggest issue I have is that it’s REALLY long. Even when it’s folded like in the picture there is way too much space in the top and if you fold it any higher then the design doesn’t sit right. Also the design feels like a when a kid irons on a decal onto a cheap shirt and I feel like if I wash it the design will come off
Me agrada su eficiencia
