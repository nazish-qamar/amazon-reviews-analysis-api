Grandson wears
excelente para el invierno
My grandson can wear this every winter. Loves it.
My 13 year old loves this beanie and wears it all the time. Good quality.
Absolutely JUNK !!
Fit perfct good material super cute!!!
Very thin material. Over sized. Print is glued on.  Cheap. Cheap. Cheap.
No structure it's an upside bag
Softnesses
Hat has no shape to it and the material is to stretchy so it hard to made it fit
The beanie was soft. That's about the only good quality of it. The writing is barely even legible. The color is more like snot green, or a shade of nasty vomit. The hat is more likely to fit a giants head. It is huge.It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, but I'm to ashamed to even give it to him now because it looks so bad. I'd be to embarrassed for him to even wear it out of the house.Not happy with it at all.
Overall, not impressed with this buy. A few washes and I‚Äôm positive the picture will no longer exist. It‚Äôs as if it was ironed on.
It was nice, just weird stretchy material
Cool hat. I also have it in gray.
Not as described, material is very odd and paper thin. The scorpion is a sticker that was almost falling off.
Horrible hat fits improperly cobra symbol came upside down
Despite reviews, I bought this.  Made out of cheap t-shirt material and the snake is not a patch - it's a sticker. Not worth it to return
WARM AND LIGHT WEIGHT
It's not what I expected it to look like, but it's a warm hat and clearly indicates the wearer's love for Jesus. I don't like the material it's made with.
Didn‚Äôt love the quality of the screen printing on this. Runs large and kind of slouchy!
Me agrada su eficiencia
Way too big. Looks very tacky and cheaply made.
Cheap print. Super thin. Worst shape.
Print was too small... cheaply made
This was a gift for my 22 yr old son. He loves it! Arrived quickly.
Material doesn't hold shape it's very loose and quality is just disappointing
This hat didn't look anything like what is advertised.
It was a gift to my future dil she loves sunflowers and liked it very much.
It‚Äôs soft. My kid likes it.
I bought this for my son's girlfriend and she loves it!
Hat looks a little flimsy not really tabagon style as pictured
Ummm. I gave it stars because it did came in on time. But im a little disappointed because of the price and the quality of the beenie. I feel like the logo should've been bigger to cover the whole beenie but it wasn't It's so small there's more hat than there is design. But my son loves it reguardless but I wouldn't put anymore of money towards anything from here again.
My nephew LOVED his hat!!  Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
This hat is so cheaply made.
Oddly shaped not like a typical beanie shape, words are not like the picture, no embroidery just an iron on, 4 stars because Jesus anything is awesome!
This fit perfectly. Highly recommend.
I ordered this for my 11 year old great grandson. I didn't know if he would of liked it. Well, he loved it!
The material is cotton and shaped oddly...... I am returning the two I bought for my grandsons!
Read the title
I feel bad leaving a bad review but I was pretty disappointed with this beanie. I bought this for a mom to give to her teen son for Christmas since she's going through some hard times. Was really disappointed when it arrived and wound up asking for a refund. Very thin material. Not much elasticity and not that it mattered cause this hat is just too big... Even for my husbands big ole head.
The image and description lead you to believe this is a decent looking professionally made beanie. When we got it it looks like its home made and done cheaply, this isnt worth half of the asking price... Go buy a better beanie and a heat transfer and make your own and you will get a better product.
Very cheap material
I cant return it because I sent it to someone who lives far and they can't send it back to me but it is way way too big for a 16 year old boy and I am very upset that he got this crappy so so so big hat that he can not use now for his Christmas. I wasted my money and the boy is upset ans do am I. They should refund me so I can buy him something else for Christmas. This is so sad!
The item shipped quickly but the design was pretty printed on crooked so it didn't look very good. Will be returning for a replacement that is hopefully not sideways.
"This was by far my worst Amazon purchase ever. The quality is horrible its not even a beanie its like a thin bag. The ""Trust me I'm a gamer"" part is sooo small and like a poop colored green not bright green. The Hat is huge. Definitely will not recommend to anyone."
This is made of T-shirt material not something to keep your heard warm. The logo is smaller than pictured and not even centered. Very poor quality. Super disappointed
It says Trust Me I'm Gamer... :(
It‚Äôs not a bad hat. I got it to cover my head when I play airsoft and it‚Äôs lightweight which is nice because it gets really hot there. The biggest issue I have is that it‚Äôs REALLY long. Even when it‚Äôs folded like in the picture there is way too much space in the top and if you fold it any higher then the design doesn‚Äôt sit right. Also the design feels like a when a kid irons on a decal onto a cheap shirt and I feel like if I wash it the design will come off
Very disappointed, nothing like the picture. Poor quality.
This hat is super cute. Fits true to size. Soft thick material. It‚Äôs not a typical knit hair the material is thicker.
This is Not a typical knit hat. This is a very Large size, Jersey knit hat with a cheap iron on decal, not a patch. Picture was deceiving. Oh Well now it's an only hat left to wear kind of hat
I bought this hat for my boyfriend for Christmas. He is an advid gamer and got a real kick out of it. ü§£ the only thing I wish was better was the thickness of the hat, but was overall nice.
