 This is the second pair of SG500 headphones from Senzer that I've owned.  I gifted the first pair to a family member and decided to grab another pair for myself.  I love how light and comfortable they feel and the sound quality is pretty darn good!Pros:- Build quality- Comfort around the ears- Soft- Light weight- Foldable and easy to travel with- PC, consoles, iPhones, iPads, Android devices (Non-usb c or lightning port)Cons:- Microphone is permanent attachedOverall: Solid little headset, great band for the buck.  100% would recommend.
I've been using these headphones for work.  I needed something that had a mic that wasn't attached to the wire part of the headphones.  I was using the Beats Solo3 and the mic on the wire would always rub against my shirt or hair and my coworkers would be able to hear that during zoom meetings.  Also tried going wireless with the beats and my mic wasn't as clear.First off, these headphones are REALLY comfortable.  There's no squeezing on my head at all and the memory foam ear pads are squishy.  I'm able to wear these all day for work (around 8-10 hours a day) with no headache or neck aches.  My head is also small and these fit perfectly when they aren't extended, I was a little worried since they look huge in the listing.  So these would be great for kids as well as small adults.  They are able to extend for larger heads though.  I like that these also are able to fold up so I can leave them neatly on the side when I'm not working.  The earpads are magnetic and can be removed, not sure why anyone would remove them though unless it's to change themThe best part for me is how simple it is to connect these to my computer.  It's just one cord vs. how some gaming headsets have an auxiliary and USB hookup.  These come with an adapter but I've been fine using just the main input aux cord.The sound quality is what you'd expect from a $40 pair of headphones.  Not as amazing as those $300 noise canceling Bose but decent enough where I can't hear the AC running in the background if I have music playing.  Also the bass on these is surprisingly clear and not distorted like most cheap headphones.  I'm definitely happy with the sound quality for $40Pros:- Lightweight and portable- Extremely Comfortable- Cool design (they look like pilot headphones or something)- Simple plug in and play (one cord)- Decent sound quality and bassCons:- Wish the mic could swivel vs. bending the wire upward every time I want it out of the way.  Curious how long the mic wire will last if I keep bending it upward when I'm not using it- There's a knob on the left side that I don't think does anything?

 I am so glad I found these headphones on Amazon. I would give these headphones 10 Stars if I could. I base that assessment on the sound quality and the price. I DJ and I use very expensive Sony and Denon headphones. These headphones cost $200 retail. I can turn them up so loud that I have to take them off my head because it's too loud and they won't break. These headphones for $50 are very comparable but the sound quality is better. The drivers that are used in these produce super clear sound. Not only that the way that each headphone is made with a large cavity, they produce very good base. Then the comfort just takes these over the top. The cushions on these headphones are so soft and I could wear them for hours. The first thing I did to test them was plugged them into my PC and play some music through them. I was blown away with how clear the sound was and this is using the onboard video from my PC and not a sound card. I turn them up as loud as they would go with the volume on my PC and they did not distort one bit. I love that you can tilt the microphone up away from your face if you're going to be using the headphones for music. It comes with the y splitters so that you could plug into your mic on a PC as well. The microphone quality is very good. He's really add a lot of depth and quality to a gaming experience. I literally hid them in a cabinet because I don't want my 16-year-old son to try them because then he's going to want to pair because they smoke his pair I've had phones. I really like the retro nostalgic look of these headphones as well. Man, if you're looking for a really good pair of headphones even just to play music on, I highly recommend these! Buy them now! He will be very happy that you did period trust me. I know that if I ever break my DJ headphones I will not buy another pair and just use these. I could buy four pairs of these for the price I paid for one of my DJ headphones.
"Just to preface, I will be returning this product after I have written this review for the reasons specified below.This headset is really good for the price but there are very specific problems which I think the average person might be able to overlook but I can't seem to in the case of these headphones. They are the pinnacle of ""bargain"" gamer headphones and you really do get what you pay for. If you are skeptical or on the fence about buying them since they seem to have decent reviews, don't. Out the box the sound quality is very bad and severely muffled. To get good sound quality they do need some burn in but after that they are ok. The fabric covering the speakers is way too thick and blocks a lot of the sound. They are also very cheaply made. While all the comfort features seem nice like the feel of the ""leather"" pads and the cord is nice, I did take out some screws to have a look inside and there is literally nothing holding the internals in place but hot glue and masking tape, yes, masking tape. Not only that but I bought 2 of them, one for me and one for my little brother. BOTH have really weak right speakers while the left speakers are like bass canons. Honestly these could have been some miracle working budget gaming headphones if they didn't have this problem since the directional audio is really good and the soundstage is decent. Surprisingly the mic quality is rather nice but honestly, I really can't get over how different the audio sounds between the two speakers. Gotta send em back..."
Overall I would rate this product as a 4 out of 5. While these gaming headphones do have a sleek visual appeal, a comfortable cushion around the ear, and an easy to adjust microphone, there are some issues. The only reason I have this product a 4-Star rating is because the microphone is very sensitive and picks up all sounds nearby, including footsteps if mobile and on a call. When not mobile, if you are not in a very silent room, communication becomes difficult because of this issue, especially if you have children. These headphones are soft and easily adjustable and the microphone adjuster on the chord is very handy, save being a bit bulky, but the 6 foot padded chord seems to be sturdy and well made. Overall a good product.
These gaming headphones are more than attractive! I've spent three solid weeks with these and many hours getting the full experience of these headphones.Plugging the 3.5mm jack directly into my PlayStation 4 controller I was able to freely move around with no extra wires and I could easily adjust my volume.If you are NOT into over the ear headphones, you may want to find something else. For those who enjoy the full effect with over the ear headphones, there were MADE for us! I played at least three hours a few times out of the three weeks and barely felt discomfort.In all, these are the smoothest pair of headphones I have from the other three I now have on my shelf; Crisp audio, lightweight with a clean design, looks like a professional upgrade, and easy to maintain.Try them and see for yourself.Meanwhile, I'll be back in a couple of months to update my review.

Really good head phones that you can hear all your in game surroundings as well as listen to crisp high quality music. I've used these for games ranging from world of warcraft to Minecraft and all the games I played sound amazing. Good audio from the mic and the split adapter makes it so I don't worry about having unessaey use of the audio from my surroundings if I just want to play and not speak. The cord is really long compared to most wired headphones giving you a range of freedom with your movement between games.Favorite part is the style of the headphones mach a older stile from the 90s that I loved and couldn't find for the longest time and the headphones actually go around your entire ear. And these pics were taken in a class with like 18 other people speaking and the only time I really hurd anything was when I took it off.
These hit the top end of what I'm willing to pay for headphones, and I'm glad they deliver at the price.Audio is good, I feel that in game I get a good sense of space. I wouldn't call it 7.1 surround, but it's very good. The microphone does a fine job on PC, though it seems to not have worked as well on my Mac for some reason.I wish the knob on the earcup did something or was just removed, but otherwise I have no beef with the build. In fact, the way the band is makes them more comfortable on my big head.They're so comfortable in fact that you don't get achy after hours of gaming, which is very nice.

 They sound good, feel great & work well. Watch the video for full information.
For gaming, crucial listening when mixing, making sales discovery calls, listening for inflections, excellent value in quality manufactured, hand-assembled product.  Look at my pics - strain reliefs that are made to actually relieve stress and help increase the life of the product over time!  Good work, you guys!!!  A side-moumted stereo potentiometer and a switch on/off microphone mute that is not just a cough button but can work as one.  A heavy-duty cable with outer-coating that screams of being professional-quality!  You never have to wonder if you are wearing the headset with the right cup over the correct ear!  Problem solved!!  It adjusts easily for head size and is just snug enough not to slip off or squash your head when adjusted and balanced correctly on both sides.  Even the mic floats on a wire so it can be repositioned without making noise.  I did EQ the headset to my personal EQ settings and the mic is great for voice communications yet I still used it to cut a spot and used post-production processing and the client loved it.  So this headset gets 5 stars for being able to.keep up with headsets costing up to $150 or more - I expect it to last a very long time, including the plug itself, which so far has been rock-solid and surprisingly reliable as well and if course has a great strain relief design as well.  Congratulations for making a great product that is a great value.------------Product Update:The ear cups are the weakest part of the product.  They have thin plastic wrapped around foam and have fallen apart from wear in just 3-4 months of use.  The left cup fell off altogether, being held on by a strong magnet.  Am incentive business reply card for warranty and review request resulted in never receiving the promised incentive, which is not why I wrote the review I did - I still like the sound from the headphones and the quality.on the strain relief and the important areas to secure the wiring, but the plastic needed to be just a few mil thicker not to tear when the headset is removed and slid on so often when you are stuck to it in the heat of gaming battle (or recording kids' radio shows!).  Return period is way too short.  Let's see if manufacturer resolves for me.
